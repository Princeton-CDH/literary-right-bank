This repository contains the JavaScript code and the data to produce the map
used in an article about Paris’s 16th arrondissement and its relation to the
Shakespeare and Co. bookshop and lending library in interwar Paris.

It makes up part of the [Shakespeare and Company
Project](http://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu) hosted by Princeton
University.

The code was written by [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](http://github.com/muziejus/)
and the geocoding was done by several people who will be named soon, including
Joshua Kotin.
